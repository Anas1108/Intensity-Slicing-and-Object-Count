# Digital Image Processing - Intensity Slicing and Object Count

## Problem Description

This project implements intensity slicing to separate objects in a digital image and counts the number of pixels for each object. The implementation uses OpenCV library for image processing tasks.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV 4.x
- Numpy

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Place the input image in the same directory as the code.
3. Run the code using the following command:

- python intensity_slicing.ipynb --image <input_image>


## Output
The code will display the original image, the image after intensity slicing and a window with the number of pixels for each object displayed inside the corresponding object.

## Note
Make sure to have the required libraries installed before running the code.
